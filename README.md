blockchain api in src/app/stores/NebStore.ts

//to send transaction
`sendTransaction = (to, value, callFunction, callArgs, listener)`

//only call
`call = (to, callFunction, callArgs)`


A bare minimum mobx-react-typescript-webpack-i18n-mst-antd

Note that this project does not include **Server-Side Rendering**,  **Testing Frameworks** and other stuffs that makes the package unnecessarily complicated.

Ideal for creating React apps from the scratch.
